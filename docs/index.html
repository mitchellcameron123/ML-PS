<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Regression Shrinkage and Selection via the Lasso;,citation_abstract=We propose a new method for estimation in linear models. The ’lasso’ minimizes the residual sum of squares subject to the sum of the absolute value of the coefficients being less than a constant. Because of the nature of this constraint it tends to produce some coefficients that are exactly 0 and hence gives interpretable models. Our simulation studies suggest that the lasso enjoys some of the favourable properties of both subset selection and ridge regression. It produces interpretable models like subset selection and exhibits the stability of ridge regression. There is also an interesting relationship with recent work in adaptive function estimation by Donoho and Johnstone. The lasso idea is quite general and can be applied in a variety of statistical models: extensions to generalized regression models and tree-based models are briefly described.;,citation_author=Robert Tibshirani;,citation_publication_date=1996;,citation_cover_date=1996;,citation_year=1996;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2346178;,citation_issue=1;,citation_volume=58;,citation_journal_title=Journal of the Royal Statistical Society;">

Limitations in COVID-19 data availability and quality remain obstacles to conducting conclusive studies on this topic. At present, publicly available COVID-19 outcome data for representative populations are available only as area-level counts. Therefore, studies of long-term exposure to air pollution and COVID-19 outcomes using these data must use an ecological regression analysis, which precludes controlling for individual-level COVID-19 risk factors. We describe these challenges in the context of one of the first preliminary investigations of this question in the United States, where we found that higher historical PM2.5 exposures are positively associated with higher county-level COVID-19 mortality rates after accounting for many area-level confounders. Motivated by this study, we lay the groundwork for future research on this important topic, describe the challenges, and outline promising directions and opportunities.;,citation_author=X.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Credibility of propensity score matching estimates. An example from Fair Trade certification of coffee producers;,citation_abstract=Propensity score matching (PSM) is an increasingly popular method for evaluation studies in agricultural and development economics. However, statisticians and econometricians have stressed that results rely on untestable assumptions, and therefore, guidelines for researchers on how to improve credibility have been developed. We follow one of these guidelines with a data set analysed by other authors to evaluate the impact of Fair Trade certification on the income of coffee producers. We provide thereby a best practice example of how to evaluate the credibility of PSM estimates. We find that a thorough assessment of the assumptions made renders the data we use not suitable for a credible PSM estimation of the effects of treatment. We conclude that the debate about the impact of Fair Trade certification would greatly benefit from a detailed reporting of credibility checking.;,citation_author=Nicolas Lampach;,citation_author=Ulrich B.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Optimizing variance-bias trade-off in the TWANG package for estimation of propensity scores;,citation_abstract=While propensity score weighting has been shown to reduce bias in treatment effect estimation when selection bias is present, it has also been shown that such weighting can perform poorly if the estimated propensity score weights are highly variable. Various approaches have been proposed which can reduce the variability of the weights and the risk of poor performance, particularly those based on machine learning methods. In this study, we closely examine approaches to fine-tune one machine learning technique [generalized boosted models (GBM)] to select propensity scores that seek to optimize the variance-bias trade-off that is inherent in most propensity score analyses. Specifically, we propose and evaluate three approaches for selecting the optimal number of trees for the GBM in the twang package in R. Normally, the twang package in R iteratively selects the optimal number of trees as that which maximizes balance between the treatment groups being considered. Because the selected number of trees may lead to highly variable propensity score weights, we examine alternative ways to tune the number of trees used in the estimation of propensity score weights such that we sacrifice some balance on the pre-treatment covariates in exchange for less variable weights. We use simulation studies to illustrate these methods and to describe the potential advantages and disadvantages of each method. We apply these methods to two case studies: one examining the effect of dog ownership on the owner’s general health using data from a large, population-based survey in California, and a second investigating the relationship between abstinence and a long-term economic outcome among a sample of high-risk youth.;,citation_author=Layla Parast;,citation_author=Daniel F.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Minimum Wages and Employment: A Case Study of the Fast-Food Industry in New Jersey and Pennsylvania;,citation_abstract=On April 1, 1992, New Jersey’s minimum wage rose from $4.25 to $5.05 per hour. To evaluate the impact of the law we surveyed 410 fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and eastern Pennsylvania before and after the rise. Comparisons of employment growth at stores in New Jersey and Pennsylvania (where the minimum wage was constant) provide simple estimates of the effect of the higher minimum wage. We also compare employment changes at stores in New Jersey that were initially paying high wages (above $5) to the changes at lower-wage stores. We find no indication that the rise in the minimum wage reduced employment.;,citation_author=David Card;,citation_author=Alan B Krueger;,citation_publication_date=1994;,citation_cover_date=1994;,citation_year=1994;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.3386/w4509;,citation_volume=84;,citation_journal_title=American Economic Review;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Why Propensity Scores Should Not Be Used for Matching;,citation_abstract=We show that propensity score matching (PSM), an enormously popular method of preprocessing data for causal inference, often accomplishes the opposite of its intended goal - thus increasing imbalance, inefficiency, model dependence, and bias. The weakness of PSM comes from its attempts to approximate a completely randomized experiment, rather than, as with other matching methods, a more efficient fully blocked randomized experiment. PSM is thus uniquely blind to the often large portion of imbalance that can be eliminated by approximating full blocking with other matching methods. Moreover, in data balanced enough to approximate complete randomization, either to begin with or after pruning some observations, PSM approximates random matching which, we show, increases imbalance even relative to the original data. Although these results suggest researchers replace PSM with one of the other available matching methods, propensity scores have other productive uses.;,citation_author=Gary King;,citation_author=Richard Nielsen;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1017/pan.2019.11;,citation_issn=14764989;,citation_volume=27;,citation_journal_title=Political Analysis;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Causal Inference in the Presence of Interference in Sponsored Search Advertising;,citation_abstract=In classical causal inference, inferring cause-effect relations from data relies on the assumption that units are independent and identically distributed. This assumption is violated in settings where units are related through a network of dependencies. An example of such a setting is ad placement in sponsored search advertising, where the likelihood of a user clicking on a particular ad is potentially influenced by where it is placed and where other ads are placed on the search result page. In such scenarios, confounding arises due to not only the individual ad-level covariates but also the placements and covariates of other ads in the system. In this paper, we leverage the language of causal inference in the presence of interference to model interactions among the ads. Quantification of such interactions allows us to better understand the click behavior of users, which in turn impacts the revenue of the host search engine and enhances user satisfaction. We illustrate the utility of our formalization through experiments carried out on the ad placement system of the Bing search engine.;,citation_author=Razieh Nabi;,citation_author=Joel Pfeiffer;,citation_author=Denis Charles;,citation_author=Emre Kıcıman;,citation_publication_date=2022;,citation_cover_date=2022;,citation_year=2022;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://arxiv.org/abs/2010.07458;,citation_doi=10.3389/fdata.2022.888592;,citation_issn=2624909X;,citation_volume=5;,citation_journal_title=Frontiers in Big Data;">

Changes in burn severity over time, however, have not been well documented in forest and woodland ecosystems in the southwestern US. Using remotely sensed burn severity data from 1621 fires (&amp;amp;amp;gt;404 ha), we assessed trends from 1984 to 2015 in Arizona and New Mexico in (1) number of fires and total area burned in all vegetation types; (2) area burned, area of high-severity, and percent of high-severity fire in all forest and woodland areas; and (3) area burned, area of high-severity, and percent of high-severity in seven different grouped forest and woodland vegetation types (Ecological Response Unit [ERU] Fire Regime Types). Number of fires and area burned increased across the Southwest regardless of vegetation type. The significant increasing trends held for area burned, area of high-severity, and percent of high-severity fire in all forest and woodland ecosystems. Area burned and area burned severely increased in all seven ERU Fire Regime Types while percent of high-severity fire increased in two ERUs: Mixed Conifer Frequent Fire and Mixed Conifer with Aspen/Spruce Fir. Managers must face the implications of increasing, uncharacteristic high-severity fire in many ecosystems as climate change and human pressures continue to affect fire regimes.;,citation_author=Megan P.

The algorithms leam a &amp;amp;amp;quot;balanced&amp;quot; representation such that the induced treated and control distributions look similar, and we give a novel and intuitive generalization-error bound showing the expected ITE estimation error of a representation is bounded by a sum of the standard generalization-error of that representation and the distance between the treated and control distributions induced by the representation. We use Integral Probability Metrics to measure distances between distributions, deriving explicit bounds for the Wasserstein and Maximum Mean Discrepancy (MMD) distances.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Propensity score model overfitting led to inflated variance of estimated odds ratios;,citation_abstract=Objective Simulation studies suggest that the ratio of the number of events to the number of estimated parameters in a logistic regression model should be not less than 10 or 20 to 1 to achieve reliable effect estimates. Applications of propensity score approaches for confounding control in practice, however, do often not consider these recommendations. Study Design and Setting We conducted extensive Monte Carlo and plasmode simulation studies to investigate the impact of propensity score model overfitting on the performance in estimating conditional and marginal odds ratios using different established propensity score inference approaches. We assessed estimate accuracy and precision as well as associated type I error and type II error rates in testing the null hypothesis of no exposure effect. Results For all inference approaches considered, our simulation study revealed considerably inflated standard errors of effect estimates when using overfitted propensity score models. Overfitting did not considerably affect type I error rates for most inference approaches. However, because of residual confounding, estimation performance and type I error probabilities were unsatisfactory when using propensity score quintile adjustment. Conclusion Overfitting of propensity score models should be avoided to obtain reliable estimates of treatment or exposure effects in individual studies.;,citation_author=Tibor Schuster;,citation_author=Wilfrid Kouokam Lowe;,citation_author=Robert W.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Marginal structural models in clinical research: When and how to use them?;,citation_abstract=Marginal structural models are a multi-step estimation procedure designed to control for the effect of confounding variables that change over time, and are affected by previous treatment. When a time-varying confounder is affected by prior treatment standard methods for confounding control are inappropriate, because over time the covariate plays both the role of confounder and mediator of the effect of treatment on outcome. Marginal structural models first calculate a weight to assign to each observation. These weights reflect the extent to which observations with certain characteristics (covariate values) are under-represented or over-represented in the sample with the respect to a target population in which these characteristics are balanced across treatment groups. Then, marginal structural models estimate the outcome of interest taking into account these weights. Marginal structural models are a powerful method for confounding control in longitudinal study designs that collect time-varying information on exposure, outcome and other covariates.;,citation_author=Tyler Williamson;,citation_author=Pietro Ravani;,citation_publication_date=2017;,citation_cover_date=2017;,citation_year=2017;,citation_issue=February;,citation_doi=10.1093/ndt/gfw341;,citation_issn=14602385;,citation_pmid=28201767;,citation_volume=32;,citation_journal_title=Nephrology Dialysis Transplantation;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Causal inference in statistics: An overview;,citation_abstract=This review presents empirical researcherswith recent advances in causal inference, and stresses the paradigmatic shifts that must be undertaken in moving from traditional statistical analysis to causal analysis of multivariate data. Special emphasis is placed on the assumptions that underly all causal inferences, the languages used in formulating those assumptions, the conditional nature of all causal and counterfactual claims, and the methods that have been developed for the assessment of such claims. These advances are illustrated using a general theory of causation based on the Structural Causal Model (SCM) described in Pearl (2000a), which subsumes and unifies other approaches to causation, and provides a coherent mathematical foundation for the analysis of causes and counterfactuals. In particular, the paper surveys the development of mathematical tools for inferring (from a combination of data and assumptions) answers to three types of causal queries: (1) queries about the effects of potential interventions, (also called &amp;amp;amp;quot;causal effects&amp;quot; or &quot;policy evaluation&quot;) (2) queries about probabilities of counterfactuals, (including assessment of &quot;regret,&quot; &quot;attribution&quot; or &quot;causes of effects&quot;) and (3) queries about direct and indirect effects (also known as &quot;mediation&quot;). Finally, the paper defines the formal and conceptual relationships between the structural and potential-outcome frameworks and presents tools for a symbiotic analysis that uses the strong features of both.;,citation_author=Judea Pearl;,citation_publication_date=2009;,citation_cover_date=2009;,citation_year=2009;,citation_doi=10.1214/09-SS057;,citation_issn=19357516;,citation_volume=3;">

Of note, recent findings have demonstrated that PM2.5 may still pose a hazard to public health even at very low levels (far below national standards) of exposure.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A tutorial on propensity score estimation for multiple treatments using generalized boosted models;,citation_abstract=The use of propensity scores to control for pretreatment imbalances on observed variables in non-randomized or observational studies examining the causal effects of treatments or interventions has become widespread over the past decade. For settings with two conditions of interest such as a treatment and a control, inverse probability of treatment weighted estimation with propensity scores estimated via boosted models has been shown in simulation studies to yield causal effect estimates with desirable properties. There are tools (e.g., the twang package in R) and guidance for implementing this method with two treatments. However, there is not such guidance for analyses of three or more treatments. The goals of this paper are twofold: (1) to provide step-by-step guidance for researchers who want to implement propensity score weighting for multiple treatments and (2) to propose the use of generalized boosted models (GBM) for estimation of the necessary propensity score weights. We define the causal quantities that may be of interest to studies of multiple treatments and derive weighted estimators of those quantities. We present a detailed plan for using GBM to estimate propensity scores and using those scores to estimate weights and causal effects. We also provide tools for assessing balance and overlap of pretreatment variables among treatment groups in the context of multiple treatments.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=What Makes Forest-Based Heterogeneous Treatment Effect Estimators Work?;,citation_abstract=Estimation of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) is of prime importance in many disciplines, from personalized medicine to economics among many others. Random forests have been shown to be a flexible and powerful approach to HTE estimation in both randomized trials and observational studies. In particular “causal forests” introduced by Athey, Tibshirani and Wager (Ann. Statist. 47 (2019) 1148–1178), along with the R implementation in package grf were rapidly adopted. A related approach, called “model-based forests” that is geared toward randomized trials and simultaneously captures effects of both prognostic and predictive variables, was introduced by Seibold, Zeileis and Hothorn (Stat. Methods Med. Res. 27 (2018) 3104–3125) along with a modular implementation in the R package model4you. Neither procedure is directly applicable to the estimation of individualized predictions of excess postpartum blood loss caused by a cesarean section in comparison to vaginal delivery. Clearly, randomization is hardly possible in this setup, and thus model-based forests lack clinical trial data to address this question. On the other hand, the skewed and interval-censored postpartum blood loss observations violate assumptions made by causal forests. Here we present a tailored model-based forest for skewed and interval-censored data to infer possible predictive prepartum characteristics and their impact on excess postpartum blood loss caused by a cesarean section. As a methodological basis, we propose a unifying view on causal and model-based forests that goes beyond the theoretical motivations and investigates which computational elements make causal forests so successful and how these can be blended with the strengths of model-based forests. To do so, we show that both methods can be understood in terms of the same parameters and model assumptions for an additive model under L2 loss. This theoretical insight allows us to implement several flavors of “model-based causal forests” and dissect their different elements in silico. The original causal forests and model-based forests are compared with the new blended versions in a benchmark study exploring both randomized trials and observational settings. In the randomized setting, both approaches performed akin. If confounding was present in the data-generating process, we found local centering of the treatment indicator with the corresponding propensities to be the main driver for good performance. Local centering of the outcome was less important and might be replaced or enhanced by simultaneous split selection with respect to both prognostic and predictive effects. This lays the foundation for future research combining random forests for HTE estimation with other types of models.;,citation_author=Y.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Group Average Treatment Effects for Observational Studies;,citation_abstract=The paper proposes an estimator to make inference of heterogeneous treatment effects sorted by impact groups (GATES) for non-randomised experiments. The groups can be understood as a broader aggregation of the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) where the number of groups is set in advance. In economics, this approach is similar to pre-analysis plans. Observational studies are standard in policy evaluation from labour markets, educational surveys and other empirical studies. To control for a potential selection-bias, we implement a doubly-robust estimator in the first stage. We use machine learning methods to learn the conditional mean functions as well as the propensity score. The group average treatment effect is then estimated via a linear projection model. The linear model is easy to interpret, provides p-values and confidence intervals, and limits the danger of finding spurious heterogeneity due to small subgroups in the CATE. To control for confounding in the linear model, we use Neyman-orthogonal moments to partial out the effect that covariates have on both, the treatment assignment and the outcome. The result is a best linear predictor for effect heterogeneity based on impact groups. We find that our proposed method has lower absolute errors as well as smaller bias than the benchmark doubly-robust estimator. We further introduce a bagging type averaging for the CATE function for each observation to avoid biases through sample splitting. The advantage of the proposed method is a robust linear estimation of heterogeneous group treatment effects in observational studies.;,citation_author=Daniel Jacob;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://arxiv.org/abs/1911.02688;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Improving propensity score weighting using machine learning;,citation_abstract=Machine learning techniques such as classification and regression trees (CART) have been suggested as promising alternatives to logistic regression for the estimation of propensity scores. The authors examined the performance of various CART-based propensity score models using simulated data. Hypothetical studies of varying sample sizes (n=500, 1000, 2000) with a binary exposure, continuous outcome, and 10 covariates were simulated under seven scenarios differing by degree of non-linear and non-additive associations between covariates and the exposure. Propensity score weights were estimated using logistic regression (all main effects), CART, pruned CART, and the ensemble methods of bagged CART, random forests, and boosted CART. Performance metrics included covariate balance, standard error, per cent absolute bias, and 95 per cent confidence interval (CI) coverage. All methods displayed generally acceptable performance under conditions of either non-linearity or non-additivity alone. However, under conditions of both moderate non-additivity and moderate non-linearity, logistic regression had subpar performance, whereas ensemble methods provided substantially better bias reduction and more consistent 95 per cent CI coverage. The results suggest that ensemble methods, especially boosted CART, may be useful for propensity score weighting. Copyright  2009 John Wiley &amp;amp;amp; Sons, Ltd.;,citation_author=Brian K.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Practical Guide to Honest Causal Forests for Identifying Heterogeneous Treatment Effects;,citation_abstract=&amp;amp;amp;quot;Heterogeneous treatment effects&amp;quot;is a term which refers to conditional average treatment effects (i.e., CATEs) that vary across population subgroups. Epidemiologists are often interested in estimating such effects because they can help detect populations that may particularly benefit from or be harmed by a treatment. However, standard regression approaches for estimating heterogeneous effects are limited by preexisting hypotheses, test a single effect modifier at a time, and are subject to the multiple-comparisons problem. In this article, we aim to offer a practical guide to honest causal forests, an ensemble tree-based learning method which can discover as well as estimate heterogeneous treatment effects using a data-driven approach. We discuss the fundamentals of tree-based methods, describe how honest causal forests can identify and estimate heterogeneous effects, and demonstrate an implementation of this method using simulated data. Our implementation highlights the steps required to simulate data sets, build honest causal forests, and assess model performance across a variety of simulation scenarios. Overall, this paper is intended for epidemiologists and other population health researchers who lack an extensive background in machine learning yet are interested in utilizing an emerging method for identifying and estimating heterogeneous treatment effects.;,citation_author=Neal Jawadekar;,citation_author=Katrina Kezios;,citation_author=Michelle C.

The study shows the possibilities of using logistic regression and propensity score matching methods in human capital strategic decisions. The data used here was from a fictional data set created by IBM data scientists based on active and separated employees to uncover the factors that lead to employee attrition. For each of the 1,470 employee records, information was generated about de- mographic characteristics such as age, gender, marital status, education level, employment status and culture, compensation, and performance factors. Two logistic equations are defined for two key performance objectives, culture and work life balance. A logistic regression analysis on each equation, with support from contrast estimation, reveals a comparison between the most and least favorable responses to key performance indicators is most significant. After successfully balancing a treatment and control group using the nearest neighbor matching technique on propensity score estimates from the logistic regression, a paired t-test reveals a statistically significant difference for the work life balance key performance indi- cator. This result is interpreted as having the highest probability of successfully reducing attrition when the focus is on increasing employee responses to satisfaction levels of work life balance in comparison to other key performance indicators.;,citation_author=Matthew Kovach;,citation_publication_date=2018;,citation_cover_date=2018;,citation_year=2018;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://www.ibm.com/communities/analytics/watson-analytics-blog/hr-employee-attrition/;,citation_dissertation_institution=Bowling Green State University;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Metalearners for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects using machine learning;,citation_abstract=There is growing interest in estimating and analyzing heterogeneous treatment effects in experimental and observational studies. We describe a number of metaalgorithms that can take advantage of any supervised learning or regression method in machine learning and statistics to estimate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) function. Metaalgorithms build on base algorithms—such as random forests (RFs), Bayesian additive regression trees (BARTs), or neural networks—to estimate the CATE, a function that the base algorithms are not designed to estimate directly. We introduce a metaalgorithm, the X-learner, that is provably efficient when the number of units in one treatment group is much larger than in the other and can exploit structural properties of the CATE function. For example, if the CATE function is linear and the response functions in treatment and control are Lipschitz-continuous, the X-learner can still achieve the parametric rate under regularity conditions. We then introduce versions of the X-learner that use RF and BART as base learners. In extensive simulation studies, the X-learner performs favorably, although none of the metalearners is uniformly the best. In two persuasion field experiments from political science, we demonstrate how our X-learner can be used to target treatment regimes and to shed light on underlying mechanisms.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Variable selection for propensity score models;,citation_abstract=Despite the growing popularity of propensity score (PS) methods in epidemiology, relatively little has been written in the epidemiologic literature about the problem of variable selection for PS models. The authors present the results of two simulation studies designed to help epidemiologists gain insight into the variable selection problem in a PS analysis. The simulation studies illustrate how the choice of variables that are included in a PS model can affect the bias, variance, and mean squared error of an estimated exposure effect. The results suggest that variables that are unrelated to the exposure but related to the outcome should always be included in a PS model. The inclusion of these variables will decrease the variance of an estimated exposure effect without increasing bias. In contrast, including variables that are related to the exposure but not to the outcome will increase the variance of the estimated exposure effect without decreasing bias. In very small studies, the inclusion of variables that are strongly related to the exposure but only weakly related to the outcome can be detrimental to an estimate in a mean squared error sense. The addition of these variables removes only a small amount of bias but can increase the variance of the estimated exposure effect. These simulation studies and other analytical results suggest that standard model-building tools designed to create good predictive models of the exposure will not always lead to optimal PS models, particularly in small studies.

This study examines the relationship between MA use and HIV risk behavior among men who inject drugs (MWID) in Tehran, Iran, using coarsened exact matching (CEM). Methods: Data for these analyses were derived from a cross-sectional study conducted between June and July 2016. We assessed three outcomes of interest - all treated as binary variables, including distributive and receptive needle and syringe (NS) sharing and condomless sex during the month before interview. Our primary exposure of interest was whether study participants reported any MA use in the month prior to the interview. Firstly, we report the descriptive statistics for the pooled samples and matched sub-samples using CEM. The pooled and matched estimates of the associations and their 95% CI were estimated using a logistic regression model. Results: Overall, 500 MWID aged between 18 and 63 years (mean = 28.44, SD = 7.22) were recruited. Imbalances in the measured demographic characteristics and risk behaviors between MA users and non-users were attenuated using matching. In the matched samples, the regression models showed participants who reported MA use were 1.82 times more likely to report condomless sex (OR = 1.82 95% CI 1.51, 4.10; P = 0.031), and 1.35 times more likely to report distributive NS sharing in the past 30 days, as compared to MA non-users (OR = 1.35 95% CI 1.15-1.81). Finally, there was a statistically significant relationship between MA use and receptive NS sharing in the past month. People who use MA in the last month had higher odds of receptive NS sharing when compared to MA non-users (OR = 4.2 95% CI 2.7, 7.5; P = 0.013).

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Model-Based Direct Ad justment;,citation_abstract=Direct adjustment or standardization applies population weights to sub- class means in an effort to estimate population quantities from a sample that is not representative of the population. Direct adjustment has several attractive features, but when there are many subclasses it can attach large weights to small quantities of data, often in a fairly erratic manner. In the extreme, direct adjustment can attach infinite weight to nonexistent data, a noticeable inconvenience in practice. This article proposes a method of model-based direct adjustment that preserves the attractive features of conventional direct adjustment while stabilizing the weights attached to small subclasses. The sample mean and conventional direct adjustment are both special cases of model-based direct adjustment under two different extreme models for the subclass-specific selection proba- bilities. The discussion of this method provides some insights into the behavior of true and estimated propensity scores: the estimated scores are better than the true ones for almost the same reason that direct adjustment can outperform the sample mean in a simple random sample.

However, recent trends in ambient&nbsp;concentrations of&nbsp;particulate matter with diameters less than 2.5 $\mu$m (PM2.5), a pollutant regulated under the Clean Air Act1, have stagnated or begun to reverse throughout much of the USA5. Here we use a combination of ground- and satellite-based air pollution data from 2000 to 2022 to quantify the contribution of wildfire smoke to these PM2.5 trends. We find that since at least 2016, wildfire smoke has influenced trends in average annual PM2.5 concentrations in nearly three-quarters of states in the contiguous USA, eroding about 25% of previous multi-decadal progress in reducing PM2.5 concentrations on average in those states, equivalent to 4 years of air quality progress, and more than 50% in many western states. Smoke influence on trends in the number of days with extreme PM2.5 concentrations is detectable by 2011, but the influence can be detected primarily in western and mid-western states. Wildfire-driven increases in ambient PM2.5 concentrations are unregulated under current air pollution law6 and, in the absence of further interventions, we show that the contribution&nbsp;of wildfire to regional and national air quality trends is likely to grow as the climate continues to warm.;,citation_author=Marshall Burke;,citation_author=Marissa L.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Some practical guidance for the implementation of propensity score matching;,citation_abstract=Propensity score matching (PSM) has become a popular approach to estimate causal treatment effects. It is widely applied when evaluating labour market policies, but empirical examples can be found in very diverse fields of study. Once the researcher has decided to use PSM, he is confronted with a lot of questions regarding its implementation. To begin with, a first decision has to be made concerning the estimation of the propensity score. Following that one has to decide which matching algorithm to choose and determine the region of common support. Subsequently, the matching quality has to be assessed and treatment effects and their standard errors have to be estimated. Furthermore, questions like ’what to do if there is choice-based sampling?’ or ’when to measure effects?’ can be important in empirical studies. Finally, one might also want to test the sensitivity of estimated treatment effects with respect to unobserved heterogeneity or failure of the common support condition. Each implementation step involves a lot of decisions and different approaches can be thought of. The aim of this paper is to discuss these implementation issues and give some guidance to researchers who want to use PSM for evaluation purposes.  2008 The Authors Journal compilation  2008 Blackwell Publishing Ltd.;,citation_author=Marco Caliendo;,citation_author=Sabine Kopeinig;,citation_publication_date=2008;,citation_cover_date=2008;,citation_year=2008;,citation_issue=1;,citation_doi=10.1111/j.1467-6419.2007.00527.x;,citation_issn=09500804;,citation_volume=22;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Economic Surveys;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Causal Rule Ensemble: Interpretable Discovery and Inference of Heterogeneous Treatment Effects;,citation_abstract=In health and social sciences, it is critically important to identify subgroups of the study population where a treatment has notable heterogeneity in the causal effects with respect to the average treatment effect. Data-driven discovery of heterogeneous treatment effects (HTE) via decision tree methods has been proposed for this task. Despite its high interpretability, the single-tree discovery of HTE tends to be highly unstable and to find an oversimplified representation of treatment heterogeneity. To accommodate these shortcomings, we propose Causal Rule Ensemble (CRE), a new method to discover heterogeneous subgroups through an ensemble-of-trees approach. CRE has the following features: 1) provides an interpretable representation of the HTE; 2) allows extensive exploration of complex heterogeneity patterns; and 3) guarantees high stability in the discovery. The discovered subgroups are defined in terms of interpretable decision rules, and we develop a general two-stage approach for subgroup-specific conditional causal effects estimation, providing theoretical guarantees. Via simulations, we show that the CRE method has a strong discovery ability and a competitive estimation performance when compared to state-of-the-art techniques. Finally, we apply CRE to discover subgroups most vulnerable to the effects of exposure to air pollution on mortality for 35.3 million Medicare beneficiaries across the contiguous U.S.;,citation_author=Falco J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A critical appraisal of propensity-score matching in the medical literature between 1996 and 2003;,citation_abstract=Propensity-score methods are increasingly being used to reduce the impact of treatment-selection bias in the estimation of treatment effects using observational data. Commonly used propensity-score methods include covariate adjustment using the propensity score, stratification on the propensity score, and propensityscore matching. Empirical and theoretical research has demonstrated that matching on the propensity score eliminates a greater proportion of baseline differences between treated and untreated subjects than does stratification on the propensity score. However, the analysis of propensity-score-matched samples requires statistical methods appropriate for matched-pairs data. We critically evaluated 47 articles that were published between 1996 and 2003 in the medical literature and that employed propensity-score matching. We found that only two of the articles reported the balance of baseline characteristics between treated and untreated subjects in the matched sample and used correct statistical methods to assess the degree of imbalance. Thirteen (28 per cent) of the articles explicitly used statistical methods appropriate for the analysis of matched data when estimating the treatment effect and its statistical significance. Common errors included using the log-rank test to compare Kaplan–Meier survival curves in the matched sample, using Cox regression, logistic regression, chi-squared tests, t-tests, and Wilcoxon rank sum tests in the matched sample, thereby failing to account for the matched nature of the data.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Causal Effects in Nonexperimental Studies: Reevaluating the Evaluation of Training Programs;,citation_abstract=This article uses propensity score methods to estimate the treatment impact of the National Supported Work (NSW) Demonstration, a labor training program, on postintervention earnings. We use data from Lalonde’s evaluation of nonexperimental methods that combine the treated units from a randomized evaluation of the NSW with nonexperimental comparison units drawn from survey datasets. We apply propensity score methods to this composite dataset and demonstrate that, relative to the estimators that Lalonde evaluates, propensity score estimates of the treatment impact are much closer to the experimental benchmark estimate. Propensity score methods assume that the variables associated with assignment to treatment are observed (referred to as ignorable treatment assignment, or selection on observables). Even under this assumption, it is difficult to control for differences between the treatment and comparison groups when they are dissimilar and when there are many preintervention variables. The estimated propensity score (the probability of assignment to treatment, conditional on preintervention variables) summarizes the preintervention variables. This offers a diagnostic on the comparability of the treatment and comparison groups, because one has only to compare the estimated propensity score across the two groups. We discuss several methods (such as stratification and matching) that use the propensity score to estimate the treatment impact. When the range of estimated propensity scores of the treatment and comparison groups overlap, these methods can estimate the treatment impact for the treatment group. A sensitivity analysis shows that our estimates are not sensitive to the specification of the estimated propensity score, but are sensitive to the assumption of selection on observables. We conclude that when the treatment and comparison groups overlap, and when the variables determining assignment to treatment are observed, these methods provide a means to estimate the treatment impact. Even though propensity score methods are not always applicable, they offer a diagnostic on the quality of nonexperimental comparison groups in terms of observable preintervention variables.  1999 Taylor &amp;amp;amp; Francis Group, LLC.;,citation_author=Rajeev H.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Machine Learning Methods for Estimating Heterogeneous Causal Effect;,citation_abstract=In this paper we study the problems of estimating heterogeneity in causal effects in experimental or observational studies and conducting inference about the magnitude of the differences in treatment effects across subsets of the population. In applications, our method provides a data-driven approach to determine which subpopulations have large or small treatment effects and to test hypotheses about the differences in these effects. For experiments, our method allows researchers to identify heterogeneity in treatment effects that was not specified in a pre-analysis plan, without concern about invalidating inference due to multiple testing. In most of the literature on supervised machine learning (e.g. regression trees, random forests, LASSO, etc.), the goal is to build a model of the relationship between a unit’s attributes and an observed outcome. A prominent role in these methods is played by cross-validation which compares predictions to actual outcomes in test samples, in order to select the level of complexity of the model that provides the best predictive power. Our method is closely related, but it differs in that it is tailored for predicting causal effects of a treatment rather than a unit’s outcome. The challenge is that the “ground truth” for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit: we observe the unit with the treatment, or without the treatment, but not both at the same time. Thus, it is not obvious how to use cross-validation to determine whether a causal effect has been accurately predicted. We propose several novel cross-validation criteria for this problem and demonstrate through simulations the conditions under which they perform better than standard methods for the problem of causal effects. We then apply the method to a large-scale field experiment re-ranking results on a search engine.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Does matching overcome LaLonde’s critique of nonexperimental estimators?;,citation_abstract=This paper applies cross-sectional and longitudinal propensity score matching estimators to data from the National Supported Work (NSW) Demonstration that have been previously analyzed by LaLonde (1986) and Dehejia and Wahba (1999, 2002). We find that estimates of the impact of NSW based on propensity score matching are highly sensitive to both the set of variables included in the scores and the particular analysis sample used in the estimation. Among the estimators we study, the difference-in-differences matching estimator performs the best. We attribute its performance to the fact that it eliminates potential sources of temporally invariant bias present in the NSW data, such as geographic mismatch between participants and nonparticipants and the use of a dependent variable measured in different ways for the two groups. Our analysis demonstrates that while propensity score matching is a potentially useful econometric tool, it does not represent a general solution to the evaluation problem.  2004 Elsevier B.V.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Recursive partitioning for heterogeneous causal effects;,citation_abstract=In this paper we propose methods for estimating heterogeneity in causal effects in experimental and observational studies and for conducting hypothesis tests about the magnitude of differences in treatment effects across subsets of the population. We provide a data-driven approach to partition the data into subpopulations that differ in the magnitude of their treatment effects. The approach enables the construction of valid confidence intervals for treatment effects, even with many covariates relative to the sample size, and without &amp;amp;amp;quot;sparsity&amp;quot; assumptions. We propose an &quot;honest&quot; approach to estimation, whereby one sample is used to construct the partition and another to estimate treatment effects for each subpopulation. Our approach builds on regression tree methods, modified to optimize for goodness of fit in treatment effects and to account for honest estimation. Our model selection criterion anticipates that bias will be eliminated by honest estimation and also accounts for the effect of making additional splits on the variance of treatment effect estimates within each subpopulation. We address the challenge that the &quot;ground truth&quot; for a causal effect is not observed for any individual unit, so that standard approaches to cross-validation must be modified. Through a simulation study, we show that for our preferred method honest estimation results in nominal coverage for 90% confidence intervals, whereas coverage ranges between 74% and 84% for nonhonest approaches.

In this article, we develop a nonparametric causal forest for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects that extends Breiman’s widely used random forest algorithm. In the potential outcomes framework with unconfoundedness, we show that causal forests are pointwise consistent for the true treatment effect and have an asymptotically Gaussian and centered sampling distribution. We also discuss a practical method for constructing asymptotic confidence intervals for the true treatment effect that are centered at the causal forest estimates. Our theoretical results rely on a generic Gaussian theory for a large family of random forest algorithms. To our knowledge, this is the first set of results that allows any type of random forest, including classification and regression forests, to be used for provably valid statistical inference.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Climate drivers of global wildfire burned area;,citation_abstract=Wildfire is an integral part of the Earth system, but at the same time it can pose serious threats to human society and to certain types of terrestrial ecosystems. Meteorological conditions are a key driver of wildfire activity and extent, which led to the emergence of the use of fire danger indices that depend solely on weather conditions. The Canadian Fire Weather Index (FWI) is a widely used fire danger index of this kind. Here, we evaluate how well the FWI, its components, and the climate variables from which it is derived, correlate with observation-based burned area (BA) for a variety of world regions. We use a novel technique, according to which monthly BA are grouped by size for each Global Fire Emissions Database (GFED) pyrographic region. We find strong correlations of BA anomalies with the FWI anomalies, as well as with the underlying deviations from their climatologies for the four climate variables from which FWI is estimated, namely, temperature, relative humidity, precipitation, and wind. We quantify the relative sensitivity of the observed BA to each of the four climate variables, finding that this relationship strongly depends on the pyrographic region and land type. Our results indicate that the BA anomalies strongly correlate with FWI anomalies at a GFED region scale, compared to the strength of the correlation with individual climate variables. Additionally, among the individual climate variables that comprise the FWI, relative humidity and temperature are the most influential factors that affect the observed BA. Our results support the use of the composite fire danger index FWI, as well as its sub-indices, the Build-Up Index (BUI) and the Initial Spread Index (ISI), comparing to single climate variables, since they are found to correlate better with the observed forest or non-forest BA, for the most regions across the globe.;,citation_author=Manolis Grillakis;,citation_author=Apostolos Voulgarakis;,citation_author=Anastasios Rovithakis;,citation_author=Konstantinos D.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=An introduction to propensity score methods for reducing the effects of confounding in observational studies;,citation_abstract=The propensity score is the probability of treatment assignment conditional on observed baseline characteristics. The propensity score allows one to design and analyze an observational (nonrandomized) study so that it mimics some of the particular characteristics of a randomized controlled trial. In particular, the propensity score is a balancing score: conditional on the propensity score, the distribution of observed baseline covariates will be similar between treated and untreated subjects.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Large sample properties of matching estimators for average treatment effects;,citation_abstract=Matching estimators for average treatment effects are widely used in evaluation research despite the fact that their large sample properties have not been established in many cases. The absence of formal results in this area may be partly due to the fact that standard asymptotic expansions do not apply to matching estimators with a fixed number of matches because such estimators are highly nonsmooth functionals of the data. In this article we develop new methods for analyzing the large sample properties of matching estimators and establish a number of new results. We focus on matching with replacement with a fixed number of matches. First, we show that matching estimators are not N 1/2-consistent in general and describe conditions under which matching estimators do attain N 1/2-consistency. Second, we show that even in settings where matching estimators are N 1/2-consistent, simple matching estimators with a fixed number of matches do not attain the semiparametric efficiency bound. Third, we provide a consistent estimator for the large sample variance that does not require consistent nonparametric estimation of unknown functions.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=The changing risk and burden of wildfire in the United States;,citation_abstract=Recent dramatic and deadly increases in global wildfire activity have increased attention on the causes of wildfires, their consequences, and how risk from wildfire might be mitigated. Here we bring together data on the changing risk and societal burden of wildfire in the United States. We estimate that nearly 50 million homes are currently in the wildland-urban interface in the United States, a number increasing by 1 million houses every 3 y. To illustrate how changes in wildfire activity might affect air pollution and related health outcomes, and how these linkages might guide future science and policy, we develop a statistical model that relates satellite-based fire and smoke data to information from pollution monitoring stations. Using the model, we estimate that wildfires have accounted for up to 25% of PM2.5 (particulate matter with diameter &amp;amp;amp;lt;2.5 $\mu$m) in recent years across the United States, and up to half in some Western regions, with spatial patterns in ambient smoke exposure that do not follow traditional socioeconomic pollution exposure gradients. We combine the model with stylized scenarios to show that fuel management interventions could have large health benefits and that future health impacts from climate-change-induced wildfire smoke could approach projected overall increases in temperature-related mortality from climate change-but that both estimates remain uncertain.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Biased Random Forest for Dealing with the Class Imbalance Problem;,citation_abstract=The class imbalance issue has been a persistent problem in machine learning that hinders the accurate predictive analysis of data in many real-world applications. The class imbalance problem exists when the number of instances present in a class (or classes) is significantly fewer than the number of instances belonging to another class (or classes). Sufficiently recognizing the minority class during classification is a problem as most algorithms employed to learn from data input are biased toward the majority class. The underlying issue is made more complex with the presence of data difficult factors embedded in such data input. This paper presents a novel and effective ensemble-based method for dealing with the class imbalance problem. This paper is motivated by the idea of moving the oversampling from the data level to the algorithm level, instead of increasing the minority instances in the data sets, the algorithms in this paper aims to ’oversample the classification ensemble’ by increasing the number of classifiers that represent the minority class in the ensemble, i.e., random forest. The proposed biased random forest algorithm employs the nearest neighbor algorithm to identify the critical areas in a given data set. The standard random forest is then fed with more random trees generated based on the critical areas. The results show that the proposed algorithm is very effective in dealing with the class imbalance problem.;,citation_author=Mohammed Bader-El-Den;,citation_author=Eleman Teitei;,citation_author=Todd Perry;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=7;,citation_doi=10.1109/TNNLS.2018.2878400;,citation_issn=21622388;,citation_pmid=30475733;,citation_volume=30;,citation_journal_title=IEEE Transactions on Neural Networks and Learning Systems;,citation_publisher=IEEE;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A tutorial on propensity score estimation for multiple treatments using generalized boosted models;,citation_abstract=The use of propensity scores to control for pretreatment imbalances on observed variables in non-randomized or observational studies examining the causal effects of treatments or interventions has become widespread over the past decade. For settings with two conditions of interest such as a treatment and a control, inverse probability of treatment weighted estimation with propensity scores estimated via boosted models has been shown in simulation studies to yield causal effect estimates with desirable properties. There are tools (e.g., the twang package in R) and guidance for implementing this method with two treatments. However, there is not such guidance for analyses of three or more treatments. The goals of this paper are twofold: (1) to provide step-by-step guidance for researchers who want to implement propensity score weighting for multiple treatments and (2) to propose the use of generalized boosted models (GBM) for estimation of the necessary propensity score weights. We define the causal quantities that may be of interest to studies of multiple treatments and derive weighted estimators of those quantities. We present a detailed plan for using GBM to estimate propensity scores and using those scores to estimate weights and causal effects. We also provide tools for assessing balance and overlap of pretreatment variables among treatment groups in the context of multiple treatments.

Our work builds on variance estimates for bagging proposed by Efron (1992, 2013) that are based on the jackknife and the infinitesimal jackknife (IJ). In practice, bagged predictors are computed using a finite number B of bootstrap replicates, and working with a large B can be computationally expensive. Direct applications of jackknife and IJ estimators to bagging require B = ⊖(n1.5) bootstrap replicates to converge, where n is the size of the training set. We propose improved versions that only require B = ⊖(n) replicates. Moreover, we show that the IJ estimator requires 1.7 times less bootstrap replicates than the jackknife to achieve a given accuracy.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Machine Learning in Policy Evaluation: New Tools for Causal Inference;,citation_abstract=While machine learning (ML) methods have received a lot of attention in recent years, these methods are primarily for prediction. Empirical researchers conducting policy evaluations are, on the other hand, pre-occupied with causal problems, trying to answer counterfactual questions: what would have happened in the absence of a policy? Because these counterfactuals can never be directly observed (described as the &amp;amp;amp;quot;fundamental problem of causal inference&amp;quot;) prediction tools from the ML literature cannot be readily used for causal inference. In the last decade, major innovations have taken place incorporating supervised ML tools into estimators for causal parameters such as the average treatment effect (ATE). This holds the promise of attenuating model misspecification issues, and increasing of transparency in model selection. One particularly mature strand of the literature include approaches that incorporate supervised ML approaches in the estimation of the ATE of a binary treatment, under the $\backslash$textit{unconfoundedness} and positivity assumptions (also known as exchangeability and overlap assumptions). This article reviews popular supervised machine learning algorithms, including the Super Learner. Then, some specific uses of machine learning for treatment effect estimation are introduced and illustrated, namely (1) to create balance among treated and control groups, (2) to estimate so-called nuisance models (e.g. the propensity score, or conditional expectations of the outcome) in semi-parametric estimators that target causal parameters (e.g. targeted maximum likelihood estimation or the double ML estimator), and (3) the use of machine learning for variable selection in situations with a high number of covariates.;,citation_author=Noémi Kreif;,citation_author=Karla DiazOrdaz;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://arxiv.org/abs/1903.00402;,citation_doi=10.1093/acrefore/9780190625979.013.256;,citation_journal_title=Oxford Research Encyclopedia of Economics and Finance;">

In this article we develop a general class of two-step algorithms for heterogeneous treatment effect estimation in observational studies. First, we estimate marginal effects and treatment propensities to form an objective function that isolates the causal component of the signal. Then, we optimize this data-adaptive objective function. The proposed approach has several advantages over existing methods. From a practical perspective, our method is flexible and easy to use: in both steps, any loss-minimization method can be employed, such as penalized regression, deep neural networks, or boosting; moreover, these methods can be fine-tuned by cross-validation. Meanwhile, in the case of penalized kernel regression, we show that our method has a quasi-oracle property. Even when the pilot estimates for marginal effects and treatment propensities are not particularly accurate, we achieve the same error bounds as an oracle with prior knowledge of these two nuisance components. We implement variants of our approach based on penalized regression, kernel ridge regression, and boosting in a variety of simulation set-ups, and observe promising performance relative to existing baselines.;,citation_author=X.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Propensity score adjustment using machine learning classification algorithms to control selection bias in online surveys;,citation_abstract=Modern survey methods may be subject to non-observable bias, from various sources. Among online surveys, for example, selection bias is prevalent, due to the sampling mechanism commonly used, whereby participants self-select from a subgroup whose characteristics differ from those of the target population. Several techniques have been proposed to tackle this issue. One such is Propensity Score Adjustment (PSA), which is widely used and has been analysed in various studies. The usual method of estimating the propensity score is logistic regression, which requires a reference probability sample in addition to the online nonprobability sample. The predicted propensities can be used for reweighting using various estimators. However, in the online survey context, there are alternatives that might outperform logistic regression regarding propensity estimation. The aim of the present study is to determine the efficiency of some of these alternatives, involving Machine Learning (ML) classification algorithms. PSA is applied in two simulation scenarios, representing situations commonly found in online surveys, using logistic regression and ML models for propensity estimation. The results obtained show that ML algorithms remove selection bias more effectively than logistic regression when used for PSA, but that their efficacy depends largely on the selection mechanism employed and the dimensionality of the data.;,citation_author=Ramón Ferri-García;,citation_author=María Del Mar Rueda;,citation_publication_date=2020;,citation_cover_date=2020;,citation_year=2020;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0231500;,citation_isbn=1111111111;,citation_issn=19326203;,citation_pmid=32320429;,citation_volume=15;,citation_journal_title=PLoS ONE;">
<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Causal inference for climate change events from satellite image time series using computer vision and deep learning;,citation_abstract=We propose a method for causal inference using satellite image time series, in order to determine the treatment effects of interventions which impact climate change, such as deforestation. Simply put, the aim is to quantify the ’before versus after’ effect of climate related human driven interventions, such as urbanization; as well as natural disasters, such as hurricanes and forest fires. As a concrete example, we focus on quantifying forest tree cover change/ deforestation due to human led causes. The proposed method involves the following steps. First, we uae computer vision and machine learning/deep learning techniques to detect and quantify forest tree coverage levels over time, at every time epoch. We then look at this time series to identify changepoints. Next, we estimate the expected (forest tree cover) values using a Bayesian structural causal model and projecting/forecasting the counterfactual. This is compared to the values actually observed post intervention, and the difference in the two values gives us the effect of the intervention (as compared to the non intervention scenario, i.e. what would have possibly happened without the intervention). As a specific use case, we analyze deforestation levels before and after the hyperinflation event (intervention) in Brazil (which ended in 1993-94), for the Amazon rainforest region, around Rondonia, Brazil. For this deforestation use case, using our causal inference framework can help causally attribute change/reduction in forest tree cover and increasing deforestation rates due to human activities at various points in time.;,citation_author=Vikas Ramachandra;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=http://arxiv.org/abs/1910.11492;">

In observational studies participants in different treatment conditions may also differ on pre-treatment characteristics that influence outcomes.

This article demonstrates that boosting, a modern statistical technique, can overcome many of these obstacles. The authors illustrate this approach with a study of adolescent probationers in substance abuse treatment programs.

To answer these questions, this article employs household data of 249 coffee farmers from six different cooperatives collected in the Jimma zone of Southwestern Ethiopia in 2009. Findings show that the certification of coffee cooperatives has in total a low impact on small-scale coffee producers’ livelihoods mainly due to (1) low productivity, (2) insignificant price premium, and (3) poor access to credit and information from the cooperative.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Causal inference using regression on the treatment variable;,citation_abstract=9.1 Causal inference and predictive comparisons So far, we have been interpreting regressions predictively: given the values of several inputs, the fitted model allows us to predict y, considering the n data points as a simple random sample from a hypothetical infinite &amp;amp;amp;quot; superpopulation &amp;quot; or probability distribution. Then we can make comparisons across different combinations of values for these inputs. This chapter and the next consider causal inference, which concerns what would happen to an outcome y as a result of a hypothesized &quot; treatment &quot; or intervention. In a regression framework, the treatment can be written as a variable T : 1 T i = 1 if unit i receives the &quot; treatment &quot; 0 if unit i receives the &quot; control, &quot; or, for a continuous treatment, T i = level of the &quot; treatment &quot; assigned to unit i. In the usual regression context, predictive inference relates to comparisons between units, whereas causal inference addresses comparisons of different treatments if applied to the same units. More generally, causal inference can be viewed as a special case of prediction in which the goal is to predict what would have happened under different treatment options. We shall discuss this theoretical framework more thoroughly in Section 9.2. Causal interpretations of regression coefficients can only be justified by relying on much stricter assumptions than are needed for predictive inference. To motivate the detailed study of regression models for causal effects, we present two simple examples in which predictive comparisons do not yield appropriate causal inferences.

We estimate that nearly 50 million homes are currently in the wildland-urban interface in the US, a number increasing by 1 million houses every 3 years. Using a statistical model that links satellite-based fire and smoke data to pollution monitoring stations, we estimate that wildfires have accounted for up to 25% of PM2.5 in recent years across the US, and up to half in some Western regions. We then show that ambient exposure to smoke-based PM2.5 does not follow traditional socioeconomic exposure gradients. Finally, using stylized scenarios, we show that fuels management interventions have large but uncertain impacts on health outcomes, and that future health impacts from climate-change-induced wildfire smoke could approach projected overall increases in temperature-related mortality from climate change. We draw lessons for research and policy.;,citation_author=Marshall Burke;,citation_author=Anne Driscoll;,citation_author=Jenny Xue;,citation_author=Sam Heft-Neal;,citation_author=Jennifer Burney;,citation_author=Michael W.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Comparison of various machine learning algorithms for estimating generalized propensity score;,citation_abstract=In this paper, we conducted a simulation study to evaluate the performance of four algorithms: multinomial logistic regression (MLR), bagging (BAG), random forest (RF), and gradient boosting (GB), for estimating generalized propensity score (GPS). Similar to the propensity score (PS), the ultimate goal of using GPS is to estimate unbiased average treatment effects (ATEs) in observational studies. We used the GPS estimates computed from these four algorithms with the generalized doubly robust (GDR) estimator to estimate ATEs in observational studies. We evaluated these ATE estimates in terms of bias and mean squared error (MSE). Simulation results show that overall, the GB algorithm produced the best ATE estimates based on these evaluation criteria. Thus, we recommend using the GB algorithm for estimating GPS in practice.;,citation_author=Chunhao Tu;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_fulltext_html_url=https://doi.org/10.1080/00949655.2019.1571059;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1080/00949655.2019.1571059;,citation_issn=15635163;,citation_volume=89;,citation_journal_title=Journal of Statistical Computation and Simulation;">

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Measuring the effectiveness of protected area networks in reducing deforestation;,citation_abstract=Global efforts to reduce tropical deforestation rely heavily on the establishment of protected areas. Measuring the effectiveness of these areas is difficult because the amount of deforestation that would have occurred in the absence of legal protection cannot be directly observed. Conventional methods of evaluating the effectiveness of protected areas can be biased because protection is not randomly assigned and because protection can induce deforestation spillovers (displacement) to neighboring forests. We demonstrate that estimates of effectiveness can be substantially improved by controlling for biases along dimensions that are observable, measuring spatial spillovers, and testing the sensitivity of estimates to potential hidden biases. We apply matching methods to evaluate the impact on deforestation of Costa Rica’s renowned protected-area system between 1960 and 1997. We find that protection reduced deforestation: approximately 10% of the protected forests would have been deforested had they not been protected. Conventional approaches to evaluating conservation impact, which fail to control for observable covariates correlated with both protection and deforestation, substantially overestimate avoided deforestation (by over 65%, based on our estimates). We also find that deforestation spillovers from protected to unprotected forests are negligible. Our conclusions are robust to potential hidden bias, as well as to changes in modeling assumptions. Our results show that, with appropriate empirical methods, conservation scientists and policy makers can better understand the relationships between human and natural systems and can use this to guide their attempts to protect critical ecosystem services.  2008 by The National Academy of Sciences of the USA.;,citation_author=Kwaw S.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=Metalearners for estimating heterogeneous treatment effects using machine learning;,citation_abstract=There is growing interest in estimating and analyzing heterogeneous treatment effects in experimental and observational studies. We describe a number of metaalgorithms that can take advantage of any supervised learning or regression method in machine learning and statistics to estimate the conditional average treatment effect (CATE) function. Metaalgorithms build on base algorithms—such as random forests (RFs), Bayesian additive regression trees (BARTs), or neural networks—to estimate the CATE, a function that the base algorithms are not designed to estimate directly. We introduce a metaalgorithm, the X-learner, that is provably efficient when the number of units in one treatment group is much larger than in the other and can exploit structural properties of the CATE function. For example, if the CATE function is linear and the response functions in treatment and control are Lipschitz-continuous, the X-learner can still achieve the parametric rate under regularity conditions. We then introduce versions of the X-learner that use RF and BART as base learners. In extensive simulation studies, the X-learner performs favorably, although none of the metalearners is uniformly the best. In two persuasion field experiments from political science, we demonstrate how our X-learner can be used to target treatment regimes and to shed light on underlying mechanisms. A software package is provided that implements our methods.;,citation_author=Sören R. Künzel;,citation_author=Jasjeet S. Sekhon;,citation_author=Peter J.

<meta name="citation_reference" content="citation_title=A comparison of machine learning algorithms and covariate balance measures for propensity score matching and weighting;,citation_abstract=Propensity score matching (PSM) and propensity score weighting (PSW) are popular tools to estimate causal effects in observational studies. We address two open issues: how to estimate propensity scores and assess covariate balance. Using simulations, we compare the performance of PSM and PSW based on logistic regression and machine learning algorithms (CART; Bagging; Boosting; Random Forest; Neural Networks; naive Bayes). Additionally, we consider several measures of covariate balance (Absolute Standardized Average Mean (ASAM) with and without interactions; measures based on the quantile-quantile plots; ratio between variances of propensity scores; area under the curve (AUC)) and assess their ability in predicting the bias of PSM and PSW estimators. We also investigate the importance of tuning of machine learning parameters in the context of propensity score methods. Two simulation designs are employed. In the first, the generating processes are inspired to birth register data used to assess the effect of labor induction on the occurrence of caesarean section. The second exploits more general generating mechanisms. Overall, among the different techniques, random forests performed the best, especially in PSW. Logistic regression and neural networks also showed an excellent performance similar to that of random forests. As for covariate balance, the simplest and commonly used metric, the ASAM, showed a strong correlation with the bias of causal effects estimators. Our findings suggest that researchers should aim at obtaining an ASAM lower than 10% for as many variables as possible. In the empirical study we found that labor induction had a small and not statistically significant impact on caesarean section.;,citation_author=Massimo Cannas;,citation_author=Bruno Arpino;,citation_publication_date=2019;,citation_cover_date=2019;,citation_year=2019;,citation_issue=4;,citation_doi=10.1002/bimj.201800132;,citation_issn=15214036;,citation_pmid=31090108;,citation_volume=61;,citation_journal_title=Biometrical Journal;">

<section id="preface" class="level1 unnumbered">
<h1 class="unnumbered">Preface</h1>
<p>This project is submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Master of Applied Science in Statistics at the University of Otago. My academic background in economics and politics sparked an enduring interest in causal inference, particularly its role in shaping evidence-based policymaking. However, my focus has evolved to include machine learning — a field that, while not traditionally central to economics, offers powerful tools for refining causal analysis.</p>
<p>The motivation for this project stems from my desire to bridge the gap between propensity score methods and machine learning. While the literature is rich with simulation studies, there is a noticeable lack of comprehensive, tutorial-style resources that guide readers through the application of machine learning to propensity score estimation. This project aims to fill that void, providing a practical and accessible exploration of these techniques with approachable theoretical discussion and coded examples in R. As a dedicated user of R, all the packages and methodologies discussed in this project exist in the R ecosystem. Although comparable tools exist in other languages and software.</p>
<p>The intended audience for this work includes individuals with a foundational understanding of causal inference and machine learning, particularly those interested in enhancing propensity score models. However, my discussion extends beyond propensity scores; much of what is covered is relevant to anyone using machine learning for probability prediction.</p>
<section id="acknowledgments" class="level2">
<h2 class="anchored" data-anchor-id="acknowledgments">Acknowledgments</h2>
<p>I would like to express my deepest gratitude to several individuals whose support, guidance, and encouragement have been invaluable throughout the course of this project.</p>
<p>First and foremost, I extend my sincere thanks to Associate Professor Matthew Parry, my supervisor. His Socratic method of teaching has fostered not only my academic growth but also my critical thinking abilities. I am particularly grateful for his flexibility and understanding as I navigated through various iterations and changes in the direction of this project. His patience and positivity, even as the project’s focus shifted, were invaluable, and I deeply appreciate his guidance throughout this journey.</p>
<p>I am also grateful to Dr Conor Kresin, whose knowledge of causal inference provided helpful background for this project. Additionally, my thanks go to Dr Falco J. Bargagli Stoffi, whose correspondence was incredibly helpful during earlier iterations of this project.</p>
<p>To my fellow students — Bethany, Jess, Shalini, Sarah, Maryam, Anna, Alex, Jackson, Teddy, Steven, and Chris — thank you for the camaraderie, the shared challenges, collective encouragement, and practical advice.</p>
<p>Lastly, but by no means least, I want to thank my girlfriend, Dani for her patience, support, and understanding throughout this process. I also want to express my gratitude for her meticulous help with proofreading, which has greatly improved the clarity and quality of this project.</p>

<span id="cb1-3"><a href="#cb1-3" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>This project is submitted in partial fulfillment of the requirements for the Master of Applied Science in Statistics at the University of Otago. My academic background in economics and politics sparked an enduring interest in causal inference, particularly its role in shaping evidence-based policymaking. However, my focus has evolved to include machine learning — a field that, while not traditionally central to economics, offers powerful tools for refining causal analysis.</span>
<span id="cb1-4"><a href="#cb1-4" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-5"><a href="#cb1-5" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The motivation for this project stems from my desire to bridge the gap between propensity score methods and machine learning. While the literature is rich with simulation studies, there is a noticeable lack of comprehensive, tutorial-style resources that guide readers through the application of machine learning to propensity score estimation. This project aims to fill that void, providing a practical and accessible exploration of these techniques with approachable theoretical discussion and coded examples in R. As a dedicated user of R, all the packages and methodologies discussed in this project exist in the R ecosystem. Although comparable tools exist in other languages and software. </span>
<span id="cb1-6"><a href="#cb1-6" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a></span>
<span id="cb1-7"><a href="#cb1-7" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>The intended audience for this work includes individuals with a foundational understanding of causal inference and machine learning, particularly those interested in enhancing propensity score models. However, my discussion extends beyond propensity scores; much of what is covered is relevant to anyone using machine learning for probability prediction.</span>

<span id="cb1-12"><a href="#cb1-12" aria-hidden="true" tabindex="-1"></a>First and foremost, I extend my sincere thanks to Associate Professor Matthew Parry, my supervisor. His Socratic method of teaching has fostered not only my academic growth but also my critical thinking abilities. I am particularly grateful for his flexibility and understanding as I navigated through various iterations and changes in the direction of this project. His patience and positivity, even as the project's focus shifted, were invaluable, and I deeply appreciate his guidance throughout this journey. </span>
